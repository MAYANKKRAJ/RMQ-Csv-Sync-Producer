# RMQ-Csv-Sync-Producer
# This project is a sample project which reads csv files and publish the records to RabbitMq Payload
We have three CSV files which need to be parsed and convert the parsed object to its respective model.
Once the Object converted to its model type then convert each object into json so that we can publish it into rabbit mq payload.
